So, despite my last entry, I guess nothing changed so far. I'm still slacking, haven't been to class once the last week.
The first few days make sense, I guess. But the rest are really just because of my bitchy nature.
I'm definitely retaking the Theory class next semester. I'm not sure if I'll be entirely done next semester anyway.
I also have just not been doing a lot of my assignments recently.
It could prove to be a problem.

On the positive note, some of these negative aspects could be blamed on my decision to not buy weed anymore, hopefully.
I don't know though, I still judge myself only on the negatives, but the only thing that kept my mind occupied has been just killing time playing overwatch.
Since I quit weed though, I've been trying to challenge myself a bit more in the game. I've been trying my hand at competitive recently and it's been going well.

Now though I'm irritated by the people around me way more than I used to be. Mainly Shrimpy and my family. Shrimpy has been kind of just a dick as of late. 
I've been getting more and more irritated by him, but his shit is negligable, my family however impacts me more. I can't just ignore them, they can just enter my world with no regard.

I don't know if I'm going to get better. But I've been thinking about suicide a bit more. The only thing staving me off it has just been my conversation with shrimpy. 
I do not want to give him any sort of satisfaction. The way that faggot lives his life is wrong and he should suffer for it. He merely exists as a contrarian, he does not have form without others.

Eitherway, suicide is somewhat off the table, it is the easiest. But how would I go on with just running away, I don't have marketable skills nor the body for intense labor.
Maybe suicide really is the way, I'm still struggling with that for now. Hopefully it's just the lack of dopamine fucking with my thought process.

For now, I'm just going to waste my time until I feel the need to act.
